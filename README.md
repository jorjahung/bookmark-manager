Week 6 & 7: Bookmark Manager
-----------------------------
For week 6 and 7, we built a bookmark manager similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.
